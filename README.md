## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Overview
The Light Sensitive Door Closer (LSDC) is a revolutionary solution that automates door closure using LDR sensors to detect ambient light levels. When the light intensity falls below a specified threshold, the LSDC initiates door closure, enhancing security and privacy for users.

### 1.2 Problem Identification
Conventional door closing systems lack automation, leading to privacy and security concerns when doors are left open. The LSDC addresses these issues by automatically closing doors based on light intensity, minimizing security risks and energy wastage.

### 1.3 Solution
The LSDC employs LDR sensors to detect ambient light levels. Once the light intensity crosses a threshold, it triggers a motor to close the connected door. This seamless automation ensures user privacy, security, and energy efficiency without manual intervention.

### 1.4 Justification
The LSDC's automation based on ambient light levels justifies its significance. By offering privacy, security, and energy efficiency without manual control, it enhances user convenience and promotes sustainable living.

## 2. Product Goals
### 2.1 Functionality
The LSDC uses LDR sensors strategically placed within the enclosure to detect ambient light intensity. It triggers a motor to close the door when the light level falls below the user-defined threshold. The device is designed for user-friendliness, improved security, energy conservation, and effortless door management.

### 2.2 Market Goals
- **Smart Home Automation Market:** Targeting tech-savvy homeowners seeking automation solutions.
- **Commercial and Office Spaces:** Providing reliable door closure for enhanced security and energy efficiency.
- **Eco-Conscious Consumers:** Attracting environmentally conscious users with an energy-efficient product.

### 2.3 Price
Approximate Cost per Unit: Rs. 5,000.00

## 3. Conceptual Design
In the conceptual design stage, we focus on merging key elements to create a functional product. We explore various circuit designs and enclosure options to optimize functionality. User-friendly sketches help visualize and refine concepts, ensuring creativity and innovation.
